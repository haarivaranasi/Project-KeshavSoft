Reflection
What I learned:

How to quickly set up and structure a Bootstrap project

How to remix Bootstrap components to build responsive pages

How to host projects using GitHub Pages

Challenges faced:

Choosing the right design/layout that looks professional

Adjusting placeholder images to fit the design

Solutions:

Used Bootstrap utility classes for fast styling

Integrated free placeholder images from Unsplash / Picsum

Tested layouts with Live Server in VS Code

Time Taken: ~20 minutes (from setup to final deployment)

This shows how efficient Bootstrap is for rapid UI prototyping.
